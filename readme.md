# Hi! Welcome to Gyromancy's Petit Mot French Reclist Edit!

This resource contains:
- Core reclists to make the base framework of a french CVVC format voicebank
- Extra reclists for broadening the capabilities of your Petit Mot style reclist
- Option reclists with shorter mora strings to substitute lists from this release
- base oto configs for quick configuration

# 1. The [B]asics

This resource has two use cases:
1. You want to start making a French voicebank for UTAU?
Great! Start with the listed Core_xx reclists
2.  You want to add different extensions to your existing French voicebank?
Also great! Please check if your voicebank is configured in the Petit Mot format and then choose from the different Extra_xx lists

Both use cases have associated base oto.ini files that will give you a starting point of lines when using setParam or vlabeler

The Gyroflex French Reclist Edit is based on melomad's Petit Mot CVVC / Gros Mot VCV format

# 2. Starting from [S]cratch

Is this your first time recording French? You already have recorded French, but want to try the Petit Mot format?

Please check out the Core_CVVC list first. It will get you acquainted with the vowels and consonants contained in the Continental French singing style. Supplementary resources for pronunciation and example voicebanks can be found on the utaufrance.com resource site
It is suggested to record with a BGM in OREMO at 100BPM

Next is the Core_VV_7mora list. It will add vowel transitions to your voicebank. This list is configured with 7mora, which means 7 syllables per line. If this is uncomfortable for you to record, you can substitute it with one of the two option lists, Opt_VV_5mora or Opt_VV_4mora

Finally, you will nee to record the Core_CC list. This is needed for a few consonant clusters as well as certain starting and end consonants. Please do not be afraid at the length of the recordings! You can do them at your own pace regardless of BGM or pitch, since you will only be using the consonant parts
The noted vowels on this list are also replacable! Please use whichever helping vowels makes it easiest for you to record, as long as you can naturally pronounce the consonants

Please note: the appended base oto.ini is taken 1:1 from my voicebank, Sashoune Yura_Gyrophare. You will need to check it before usage, because it is adapted to the recordings made at the time, which have not been made on a BGM

# 3. Building on [E]xpansion

You have followed the steps from 2? Or have already recorded a voicebank in the Petit Mot format?
You may now pick and choose from the Extras_xx list. They host different extensions which will extend the capabilities of your voicebank or aid it in sounding more natural

Extra_Adds contains end breaths and glottal stops
Extra_ny contains CCV sounds for smoother [ny] consonant combinations

# 4. Fine-Tuning the [C]onfig

Once you have recorded all the components you like, you will have to configure your voicebank. You can get a quick start on this by dropping the appended base oto.ini files into your associated recording folders. You then only have to rename them to "oto.ini" for them to be read by the following programs
It is recommended to use setParam or vlabeler for configuration instead of Classic UTAU and OpenUTAU's built in configurators

# 5.  Starting [U]sage

You have recorded and configured your voicebank? Congratulations! You can now start using it in UTAU
For getting started in UTAU, please refer to the tutorials found on the OpenUTAU Github page (English) or on the utaufrance.com page (French)
If you are using OpenUTAU, you can use the built-in phonemizer for French CVVC contributed by Mim
